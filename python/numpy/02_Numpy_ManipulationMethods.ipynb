    "This Jupyter Notebook is part of a series of code resources made available in the repository linked to my Medium publication on the NumPy library. The series is designed to provide readers with practical, in-depth understanding of various NumPy functionalities, an essential library for scientific computing in Python. Here, we explore everything from basic concepts and array manipulation to advanced mathematical operations and broadcasting techniques, offering detailed code examples for each topic covered.\n",

    "- transpose for the transposition of arrays.\n",
    "- concatenate for combining multiple arrays into a single array.\n",
